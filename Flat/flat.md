## With out using any built-in methods

*Here we are following recusion*
*We created an function flain(args)*

`function plain(args)` 


$$
were it accepts an array and returns an array

in this example it loops over the array and checks is current element is array or not
if(true) it receivel calls the plain function with the current element(array)

when it the function is done it returns the array the is concatinated to the initial array declared in the plain function

`let flat = [];`

where it is an closure tha holds the vale of array

else it adds the vale to the falt array declared in the plain function and returns it.
